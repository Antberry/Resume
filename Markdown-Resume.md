#### During my 10-year tenure in the military, I learned how to implement strategy at a large scale and problem solve mission-critical issues. I am seeking to apply that knowledge, as well as my technical skills, to build solutions that will impact the future. In my spare time, I am passionate about providing service to my community and have worked independently as a Homeless Advocate since 2017 to deliver food and care packages to those in need.
